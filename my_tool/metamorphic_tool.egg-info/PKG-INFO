        # Metamorphic Testing
        Metamorphic Testing is one of those testing techniques through which we can reform ML testing and mitigate the oracle problem. The idea is simple: even if we do not know the correct output of a single input, we might still know the relations between the outputs of multiple inputs, especially if the inputs are themselves related.
        
        This tool will help to automatically test your image classifier on some set of metamorphic relations.
        
        This tool is under testing phase for now. Will release our first version soon.
        
        # Install
        Run this command in your ubuntu terminal
        pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ metamorphic-tool
        
        # Requirements
        Need to install these modules before running this tool:
        1. Tensorflow
        2. Scikit-Learn
        3. Pillow
        4. opencv-python
        5. adversarial-robustness-toolbox
        6. lime
        7. Keras
        8. shutil
        9. matplotlib
        10. numpy and scipy
        
        # How to run?
        After installing this tool, run the following commands in your python terminal:
        from metamorphic_relations import <relation_name>
        
        These relation_name includes the following:
        1. mr2, mr3, mr4, mr6, mr7, mr8, mr10, mr11
        2. outliers_mr, interpretability_mr, robustness_mr, bias_mr, overfitting_mr
        
        If you run command of 1st category run:
        mr<number>.MR<number>(classiifer_path, dataset_path, height, width).output()
        
        This will run that speciifc MR for you.
        
        If you run command from 2nd category then:
        <name>_mr.<name>_MR(classiifer_path, dataset_path, height, width).output()
        
        Dataset should consists of folders containing different category images and should be labeled with 0,1,2,3....
        
        Metamorphic relations of 1st category were taken from the following paper:-
        # validating a deep learning framework by metamorphic testing.
